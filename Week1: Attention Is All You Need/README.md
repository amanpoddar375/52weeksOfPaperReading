The paper <a href="https://github.com/amanpoddar375/52weeksOfPaperReading/blob/d4351a0c9b1a34b5a1df01f4a395e392705821e5/Week1:%20Attention%20Is%20All%20You%20Need/Attention%20is%20all%20you%20need(2017).pdf">Attention Is All You Need</a> is a seminal work in the field of deep learning and natural language processing. The authors present the Transformer architecture, which is an innovative new way to model sequences using attention mechanisms instead of recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

Some key takeaways from the paper are:
<ol type = "1">
  <li><strong>Introduction of Transformer architecture:</strong> <i> The Transformer is a neural network architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequential input data. It was introduced as an alternative to the recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture and has since become one of the most widely used models in NLP.</i></li>
  
<li><strong>Attention mechanisms:</strong> <i>Attention mechanisms allow the model to weigh different input sequences to dynamically focus on the most important elements of the input at any given time. This makes the Transformer well-suited for tasks like machine translation, where the model must attend to different parts of the source sentence in order to generate a coherent target sentence.</i></li>
  
<li><strong>Improved parallelism:</strong><i> One of the key benefits of the Transformer is its ability to be fully parallelized during both training and inference. This allows it to scale to very large inputs, which has made it possible to train models on massive amounts of text data.</i></li>
  
<li><strong>Improved performance: </strong><i>The Transformer has been shown to outperform RNNs on a variety of NLP tasks, including machine translation, language modeling, and sentiment analysis.</i></li>
