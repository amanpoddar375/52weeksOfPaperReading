TableNet utilizes knowledge from previously learned tasks and can transfer that knowledge to newer, related ones, demonstrating transfer learning. This is particularly useful when training data is sparse. The model also shows improved performance when highlighting text to provide data-type information. In the future, the authors intend to train TableNet with a third branch to identify rows, but this will require manual annotation as currently datasets do not provide row-based annotations
